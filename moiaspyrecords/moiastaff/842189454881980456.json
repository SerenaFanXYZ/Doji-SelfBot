Next you will add your impact activated fireworks into said tennis balls I'd go with probably 5 or more of them per tennis ball. Then once you've done so use your ladle and add the SAP into said tennis balls, once you've properly filled them with SAP you will need to take the cap you cut off the tennis balls and super glue them back on to seal them up!\n\nOnce you've done this be very careful cause they are now armed!\nCongrats! You've made Medium Distance Impact SAP! Now have a good throwing arm and send em a good distance away from you (ATLEAST 20 FEET RECOMMENDED!!!!!!)\n\n-# Any bodily injurt is not covered in the Gavu Spicy Cookbook Warranty, use at your own risk of registry on the domestic terrorism list and time in federal prison"
